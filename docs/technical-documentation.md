## Architecture Overview
PLLAY Enterprise Solution is a full-stack application with a React frontend and a Node.js backend. It uses a microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability.

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
- Database: MongoDB
- Caching: Redis
- Real-time Communication: Socket.IO
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Payment Processing: Stripe, Cash App, Strike
- Internationalization: i18next
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Netlify

## Database Schema
(Provide a detailed description of your MongoDB schema here)

## Authentication and Authorization
We use JWT for authentication. Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies for security. The `authMiddleware` checks for valid tokens on protected routes.

## WebSocket Implementation
Socket.IO is used for real-time features like live updates for wagers and notifications. The `SocketContext` provides socket functionality throughout the app.

## Caching Strategy
Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data like user profiles and wallet balances. The cache is invalidated when the underlying data changes.

## Error Handling and Logging
We use a custom `ErrorBoundary` component for React error handling. On the backend, we use Winston for logging and a custom error middleware for consistent error responses.

## Internationalization (i18n)
i18next is used for internationalization. Language files are stored in `public/locales/`. The `LanguageSwitcher` component allows users to change languages.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit Tests: Jest and React Testing Library for component and service tests
- Integration Tests: Jest for API route testing
- End-to-End Tests: Cypress for full user flow testing

## Deployment Process
We use GitHub Actions for CI/CD. On push to main:
1. Run tests and linting
2. Build the application
3. Deploy to Netlify (frontend) and Heroku (backend)
