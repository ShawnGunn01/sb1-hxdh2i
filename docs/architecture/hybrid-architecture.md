# PLLAY Enterprise Solution - Hybrid Architecture

## Overview

The PLLAY Enterprise Solution uses a hybrid architecture that combines on-premises infrastructure with cloud services to optimize performance, security, and scalability.

## Components

### On-Premises Infrastructure

1. **Core Database Cluster**
   - Primary MongoDB cluster for storing sensitive user data, financial transactions, and game states
   - Deployed on high-performance servers with redundancy and failover capabilities

2. **Game Servers**
   - Dedicated servers for hosting real-time game sessions
   - Low-latency infrastructure for optimal gaming experience

3. **Local Cache**
   - Redis cluster for caching frequently accessed data
   - Improves response times for critical operations

4. **Security Appliances**
   - Firewalls, Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
   - Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for cryptographic operations

### Cloud Services

1. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**
   - Distributed network for serving static assets and improving global access speeds

2. **Elastic Compute Instances**
   - Auto-scaling application servers for handling variable load
   - Hosting microservices that don't require direct access to sensitive data

3. **Managed Kubernetes Cluster**
   - For orchestrating containerized services and ensuring high availability

4. **Cloud Storage**
   - Object storage for non-sensitive data, logs, and backups

5. **Analytics and Monitoring**
   - Cloud-based analytics platform for processing large datasets
   - Monitoring and alerting services for system health and performance

6. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
   - Cloud-based IAM service integrated with on-premises systems for unified access control

## Data Flow

1. User requests are first routed through the CDN for static assets
2. Dynamic requests are load-balanced to the application servers in the cloud
3. Application servers interact with the on-premises core database for sensitive operations
4. Game sessions are hosted on dedicated on-premises game servers
5. Analytics data is streamed to cloud storage for processing
6. Cached data is stored in the on-premises Redis cluster for fast access

## Security Measures

1. VPN tunnels between cloud and on-premises infrastructure
2. End-to-end encryption for all data in transit
3. Data classification to determine storage location (cloud vs. on-premises)
4. Regular security audits and penetration testing
5. Multi-factor authentication for all administrative access

## Scalability

1. Cloud-based application servers can auto-scale based on demand
2. On-premises infrastructure can be expanded as needed for increased capacity
3. CDN automatically scales to handle global traffic

## Disaster Recovery

1. Regular backups of on-premises data to cloud storage
2. Failover capabilities between on-premises and cloud infrastructure
3. Geo-redundant cloud services for high availability

## Compliance

1. Sensitive data remains on-premises to meet regulatory requirements
2. Cloud services configured to comply with data residency laws
3. Audit trails and logging across both on-premises and cloud components

This hybrid architecture provides the benefits of cloud scalability and global reach while maintaining control over sensitive operations and data through on-premises infrastructure.
